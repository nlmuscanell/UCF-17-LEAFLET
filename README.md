# Visualizing Data with Leaflet

Leaflet was used to create a map that plots all of the earthquakes for the past month (based on longitude and latitude). The data on the earthquakes come from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Interactive markers were added which varied in size based on the magnitude of the earthquake and varied in color based on the depth of the earthquake. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should darker in color. An on lick pop up feature was also included, which displays the location of the earthquake, the date/time, and magnitude.
